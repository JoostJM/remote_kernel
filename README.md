# Remote Kernel
Remote kernel is a pure-python package that utilizes `paramiko`
and `sshtunnel` to set up an ssh connection with port forwarding 
to a remote host, and start up an IPyKernel on that host.
This allows a locally running instance of Jupyter or Spyder to easily
run code on a remote server.
